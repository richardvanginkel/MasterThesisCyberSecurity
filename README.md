Abstract: Organizations use vulnerability scans to gain insight into the level of security of the digital infrastructure. Results of such a scan are often scored using Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). This regularly results in an overwhelming amount of vulnerabilities that are scored high or critical, which makes it difficult to determine which vulnerability should be remedied first. In this research project, we propose a new score calculation method based on which organizations can select the best follow-up actions with the most impact on the security level of the organization. We propose three calculation methods that we test on real vulnerability scanning data. To validate the results, we conduct a survey on experts in the field. Analysis of the results of the survey showed that taking into account the reachability of vulnerabilities and the existence of an exploit improves the scoring of vulnerabilities significantly. Our proposed method can help experts in the field of cyber security selecting which vulnerabilities to remedy first.
